Linked List while Loop Cheat Sheet
----------------------------------

1. Traverse and Print
---------------------
node = head
while node:
    print(node.val)
    node = node.next

Use when you just want to walk through the list and see the values.

2. Count Nodes
--------------
count = 0
node = head
while node:
    count += 1
    node = node.next

Use to get the length of the list manually.

3. Find a Value
---------------
target = 42
node = head
while node:
    if node.val == target:
        print("Found it!")
        break
    node = node.next

Stops early if the value is found.

4. Delete a Node (by value)
---------------------------
dummy = Node(0)
dummy.next = head
prev = dummy
curr = head

while curr:
    if curr.val == target:
        prev.next = curr.next
        break
    prev = curr
    curr = curr.next

head = dummy.next  # update head in case first node was deleted

Handles edge cases like deleting the head node.

5. Reverse a Linked List
------------------------
prev = None
curr = head

while curr:
    next_node = curr.next
    curr.next = prev
    prev = curr
    curr = next_node

head = prev  # new head after reversal

Classic in-place reversalâ€”super useful in interviews.
