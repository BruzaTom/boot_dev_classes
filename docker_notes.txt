Docker is the big name in "containerization". The big idea behind Docker and other container technologies is that they allow us to package our programs with an environment and ship the whole thing. Most real world programs don't work in isolation, they need:

    Files from disk
    Environment variables
    Installed dependencies
    Specific permissions

Docker images and containers have become a standard for deploying applications. In this course, you'll learn all about Docker and containerization.
Boot.dev CLI

Throughout this course, you'll be using the Boot.dev CLI to run our tests (which are just CLI commands) against your local environment. Install it now if you don't already have it. All the instructions and troubleshooting info are on the GitHub page.

Make sure the Boot.dev CLI install worked:

bootdev --version

If you're stuck, reach out in the help forums of the Discord.

Once the bootdev command is working, log in and follow the instructions:

bootdev login

Run vs. Submit

Lessons have a series of "commands" that run on your local machine, and a series of tests it will check against the results of the command. There are two ways to run these commands: run and submit:

    bootdev run <id>: This will run the commands and show you the results. It's to be used for debugging, but it won't tell you whether or not you've passed the tests explicitly.
    bootdev run <id> -s: This will run the commands and give you pass/fail feedback. It will also mark the lesson as complete on the website. If you get it wrong however, you'll potentially lose your sharpshooter spree, so be sure to use run first!

You can copy the run/submit commands with the id ready-to-go from the test panel.
Assignment

Once you have the CLI installed and you're logged in, copy and paste the run command from the right into your terminal and execute it. If it's doing what you'd expect (printing it works on my machine), then run the submit command.

        Install Docker


There are a couple of moving parts to keep in mind when it comes to using Docker on your local machine:

    The "Docker server" or "Docker Daemon". This listens to requests from the desktop app and executes them. If this isn't running nothing else will work.
    The "Docker Desktop" GUI. Starting the GUI should start the server, at least that's how I usually ensure the server is running. The GUI is the visual way to interact with Docker.
    The Docker CLI. As a developer, most of your work will be interacting with Docker via the CLI. I'd recommend using the GUI to visualize what's going on with Docker, but executing most of your commands through the command line.

Assignment

    Install Docker Desktop (don't worry, we'll mostly use the CLI):
        Install on macOS
        Install on Windows (or WSL 2)
        Install on Linux
    Run the Docker Desktop app. Make sure that in the bottom-left of the screen there is a green box with a whale icon in it. This indicates that the docker server is running locally and that you are connected to it. Then, make sure you're on Docker Desktop version 4+. At the time of writing, I'm on 4.40.0.
    Run docker version in your command line to make sure the CLI was installed.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

Tip

You may also want to enable shell completion for Docker.

# Install Docker
sudo pacman -S docker

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Add your user to the docker group (replace with your actual username)
sudo usermod -aG docker tomux

# Log out and back in (or reboot) to apply group change

# Verify access
docker info

# If permission denied persists:
groups                     # confirm docker group membership


          What Is Docker?


    Docker makes development efficient and predictable

    Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development – desktop and cloud. Docker’s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

    -- The Docker team

Put simply: Docker allows us to deploy our applications inside "containers", which are kind of like very lightweight virtual machines. Instead of just shipping an application, we can ship an application and the environment it runs in.

Docker is a way to define and run ____
both applications and enviornments


          Docker Hub

Docker Hub is the official cloud service for storing and sharing Docker images (we'll talk about images later, chill plz).

We'll use Docker Hub in this course, but there are other popular alternatives, and they're usually coupled with cloud service providers. For example,

    AWS ECR
    GCP Container Registry
    Azure Container Registry

For most of my career, if my company used AWS to deploy, we used AWS to host our images. If we used GCP to deploy, we hosted images on GCP. I'd usually just use whatever's most convenient and cost effective, the features are very similar between providers.

Assignment

    Create a free account on Docker Hub if you don't already have one.
    Open up your Docker Desktop app and click "Sign in". If it worked, you should see "Connected to Hub" at the bottom of the client. Having your local Docker environment connected to a Docker Hub account will make publishing your images much easier.

#had to log in to docker in my terminal by running
echo "YOUR_TOKEN_OR_PASSWORD" | docker login --username YOUR_USERNAME --password-stdin

Run and submit the CLI tests.

The docker login command in the CLI tests should exit without error because you're already logged in.
